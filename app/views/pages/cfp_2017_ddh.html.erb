	<p><em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> seeks to anthologize the best new work in the digital humanities (DH) each year. Possible topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
	
	<p>
	 <ul>
	    <li>The maturation of DH. A full decade after the field’s (re)naming, how might we think about the impact of the field? What are the underlying assumptions of current DH work, and how can they be productively challenged and re-examined?</li>
	    <li>Assessing the impact of specific tools and methods. What research results have various DH tools produced? What kinds of inquiries have they helped make possible, and what kinds of difficulties, complications, or complexities are involved in using them?</li>
	    <li>DH and its critics. What is the relationship of the field to its critics, either intellectual or institutional? Which issues have been remedied, and which issues remain unaddressed?</li>
	    <li>DH, diversity, and difference. How should DH account for diversity and difference--in race, gender, sexual orientation, and other areas--in terms of the communities that it sustains, the audiences it addresses, and the projects it supports? </li>
	    <li>Who does DH labor? How can the increasingly nuanced conversation surrounding digital labor inform our understanding of the labor involved in doing DH? How might it facilitate the reformation of older practices or the creation of new ones?</li>
	    <li>DH and activism. How might DH contribute to the analysis of current events that have placed issues of social justice on the national and international stage?</li>
	    <li>DH Pedagogy. How should the digital humanities be taught? When should or shouldn’t DH be taught? What role does DH have to play in various curricula and disciplines?</li>
	    <li>DH, the disciplines, and allied fields. How should DH be framed in relation to other humanities disciplines and departments? How do (or might) allied fields such as STS, design, computational social science, information science, and the history of computing inform or be informed by the debates in the digital humanities?</li>
	    <li>DH, libraries, and LIS schools. How is DH being integrated into 21st-century libraries? How should it be? To what extent should the research and teaching of DH and LIS programs be aligned?</li>
	    <li>DH and institutional contexts--what does DH look like at different educational levels and in institutional types?</li>
	    <li>What shared visions exist between DH initiatives and GLAM institutions? What institutional, political, and disciplinary divides complicate those visions?</li>
	    <li>DH and its publics. How is DH practiced (or how should it be) when focused on publics outside the academy? What does DH look like when focused on civic advocacy and action?</li>
	    <li>Histories and futures of the digital. How might alternate (or additional) genealogies of the field challenge existing formations of DH and suggest future possibilities?</li>
	 </ul>
	</p>

	<p>In addressing these and other debates, submissions should take an argumentative stance, advocating clearly and explicitly from a particular point of view. Scholars and practitioners from across the disciplines (regardless of rank, position, or institutional affiliation) are invited to submit 300-word abstracts on these or other topics by November 2, 2015 to the series editor, Matthew K. Gold (mgold@gc.cuny.edu) and associate editor, Lauren Klein (lauren.klein@lmc.gatech.edu). Collaboratively authored submissions are welcome.</p> 

	<p>The <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> editorial team will review all abstracts, and authors of selected abstracts will be invited to submit full essays by January 15th, 2016. The team will consult with the authors of selected abstracts about the length of their contributions, which will range from 2000 to 8000 words.</p>

	<p>We also welcome nominations of blog posts or other short-form pieces that address the above and related issues.</p>

	<p>As the series aims to introduce fully conceived scholarship on issues of pressing importance to the field, this volume will operate on a compressed production schedule. Contributors will be expected to participate in peer-to-peer and editorial review during Spring 2016; revised essays will be due April 1st 2016. The volume will be published in print and online in an open-access edition in January 2017.</p>

	<p>
	    <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> is a hybrid print/digital publication stream that explores new debates as they emerge. The call for contributions for the 2018 volume will be announced in September 2016.
