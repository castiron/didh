<p class="enp"><span class="none">This chapter was originally published on April 7, 2011, at <span class="url">http://nowviskie.org/2011/what-do-girls-dig/ and <a href="http://storify.com/nowviskie/">http://storify.com/nowviskie/</a>, first as an experiment in using the online Storify system, then in beta release. Storify allows users to annotate and weave together narrative strands from social media. All quotations are from publicly accessible posts to Twitter, a microblogging service through which much real-time conversation on the digital humanities takes place</span>.</span></p>
