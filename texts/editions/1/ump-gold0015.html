<p class="ct"><span class="none">Day of DH: Defining the Digital Humanities</span></p>
<br />
<p class="paft"><span class="none"><em>A Day in the Life of the Digital Humanities</em> (<em>Day of DH</em>) is a community publication project sponsored by the University of Alberta under the direction of Geoffrey Rockwell. Each year, it brings together digital humanists from around the world to document what they do on one day, March 18. The goal of the project is to create a website that weaves together the journals of the participants into a picture that answers the question, Just what do computing humanists really do? Participants document their day through photographs and commentary in a blog-like journal. The collection of these journals with links, tags, and comments makes up the final work that is published online.</span></p>
<p><span class="none">In advance of the <em>Day of DH</em>, participants are asked, How do you define humanities computing / digital humanities? The following selection of definitions was culled from 2011 answers to that question, which are posted publicly on the <em>Day of DH</em> website.<a class="enref" id="enp1b501r" href="#enp1b501"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>

<p class="quot"><span class="none">I think of digital humanities as an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of digital work in the humanities: development of multimedia pedagogies and scholarship, designing and building tools, human computer interaction, designing and building archives, and so on. DH is interdisciplinary; by necessity it breaks down boundaries between disciplines at the local (e.g., English and history) and global (e.g., humanities and computer sciences) levels.</span></p>

<p class="quot"><span class="none">I view the digital humanities as a collaborative, open, and emerging field of inquiry. A state of mind, a methodology, and theoretical approach to knowledge, it forces us to reconceive our practice. In my own work, I embrace curation as a means of reweaving and reintegrating theory and practice in history. I seek to interpret space, place, and identity in a multi-sensory way. I fail more often than not. But the digital humanities is like jazz in that it is about process, as well as outcome.</span></p>

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="quot"><span class="none">I think digital humanities, like social media, is an idea that will increasingly become invisible as new methods and platforms move from being widely used to being ubiquitous. For now, digital humanities defines the overlap between humanities research and digital tools. But the humanities are the study of cultural life, and our cultural life will soon be inextricably bound up with digital media.</span></p>

<p class="quot"><span class="none">The Digital Humanities is both a field with a discernable set of academic lineages, practices, and methodologies and a vague umbrella term used to describe the application of digital technology to traditional humanistic inquiry. Ultimately, what sets DH apart from many other humanities fields is its methodological commitment to building things as a way of knowing.</span></p>

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="quot"><span class="none">Digital Humanities is the integration of sophisticated, empirical techniques utilizing tools and technologies typically associated with practical sciences into the study of traditional humanities questions. It represents a more exploratory and less quantitative approach than social sciences in the use of such tools, but it also represents ambitious attempts to model nuanced human wisdom in ways that, like early flying machines, are beautiful, quite impractical and often fail.</span></p>

<p class="quot"><span class="none">Digital humanities is a metafield, a set of coevolving new knowledge and best practices expanding from traditional humanities disciplines into born-digital research and teaching methods. Digital humanists study all objects and practices of concern to analog humanities, plus those made possible by the digital age. Digital humanists also build tools that make it possible for themselves, their students, and the world at large to engage critically with our cultural heritage.</span></p>

<p class="quot"><span class="none">I don&#8217;t: I&#8217;m sick of trying to define it. When forced to, I&#8217;ll make the referent the people instead of the ideas or methods&#8212;Digital Humanities is the thing practiced by people who self-identify as Digital Humanists. It&#8217;s helpful to have a name for the field chiefly for institutional authority. Though granted I think it does involve coding/making/building/doing things with computers, things related to, you know, the humanities.</span></p>

<p class="quot"><span class="none">I think it&#8217;s a convenient label, but fundamentally I don&#8217;t believe in it. There are people who haven&#8217;t yet attempted to come to grips with how digital tools and methods can change research, teaching, and outreach in the Humanities, and those who have. The latter are Digital Humanities types. But it&#8217;s all Wissenschaft.</span></p>

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="quot"><span class="none">The digital humanities is what digital humanists do. What digital humanists do depends largely on academic discipline but also on level of technical expertise. Each discipline, with varying degrees of intensity, has over the years developed a set of favored methods, tools, and interests that, although shared with other disciplines, remains connected to the discipline. The task of the digital humanities, as a transcurricular practice, is to bring these practitioners into communication with each other and to cultivate a discourse that captures the shared praxis of bringing technologies of representation, computation, and communication to bear on the work of interpretation that defines the humanities.</span></p>

<div class="epigraph">
<p class="quot"><span class="none">I think digital humanities is an unfortunate neologism, largely because the humanities itself is a problematic term. The biggest problem is that the tent isn&#8217;t big enough! I have participated in a number of DH events and they are strikingly similar to things like Science Online.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="epigraph">
<p class="quot"><span class="none">With that said, DH is at its best when it embraces the digital not simply as a means to the traditional ends of scholarship, but when it transforms the nature of what humanists do. The digital allows for scholars, librarians, archivists, and curators to engage much more directly with each other and the public. Further, it allows them not simply to write for each other, but to build things for everyone.</span></p>
